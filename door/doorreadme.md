#novelis door model
this is node proveds a door interface service,
it should be launched with the gazebo simulation or before starting any tours 
currently (4/16/2020) it simulates the GPIO of a raspberry pi using python,
the real door would have a simmilar function where the tour guide calls a service to that interfaces with gpio pins to signal to a door to open a door
